- **Summary**: As a common image editing operation, image composition involves integrating foreground objects into background scenes. In this paper, we expand the application of the concept of Affordance from human-centered image composition tasks to a more general object-scene composition framework, addressing the complex interplay between foreground objects and background scenes. Following the principle of Affordance, we define the affordance-aware object insertion task, which aims to seamlessly insert any object into any scene with various position prompts. To address the limited data issue and incorporate this task, we constructed the SAM-FB dataset, which contains over 3 million examples across more than 3,000 object categories. Furthermore, we propose the Mask-Aware Dual Diffusion (MADD) model, which utilizes a dual-stream architecture to simultaneously denoise the RGB image and the insertion mask. By explicitly modeling the insertion mask in the diffusion process, MADD effectively facilitates the notion of affordance. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and exhibits strong generalization performance on in-the-wild images.

- **Summary**: 3D object detection is one of the fundamental perception tasks for autonomous vehicles. Fulfilling such a task with a 4D millimeter-wave radar is very attractive since the sensor is able to acquire 3D point clouds similar to Lidar while maintaining robust measurements under adverse weather. However, due to the high sparsity and noise associated with the radar point clouds, the performance of the existing methods is still much lower than expected. In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Cross-modality Knowledge Distillation (SCKD) method for 4D radar-based 3D object detection. It characterizes the capability of learning the feature from a Lidar-radar-fused teacher network with semi-supervised distillation. We first propose an adaptive fusion module in the teacher network to boost its performance. Then, two feature distillation modules are designed to facilitate the cross-modality knowledge transfer. Finally, a semi-supervised output distillation is proposed to increase the effectiveness and flexibility of the distillation framework. With the same network structure, our radar-only student trained by SCKD boosts the mAP by 10.38% over the baseline and outperforms the state-of-the-art works on the VoD dataset. The experiment on ZJUODset also shows 5.12% mAP improvements on the moderate difficulty level over the baseline when extra unlabeled data are available.

- **Summary**: Alignment-free RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) salient object detection (SOD) aims to achieve robust performance in complex scenes by directly leveraging the complementary information from unaligned visible-thermal image pairs, without requiring manual alignment. However, the labor-intensive process of collecting and annotating image pairs limits the scale of existing benchmarks, hindering the advancement of alignment-free RGB-T SOD. In this paper, we construct a large-scale and high-diversity unaligned RGB-T SOD dataset named UVT20K, comprising 20,000 image pairs, 407 scenes, and 1256 object categories. All samples are collected from real-world scenarios with various challenges, such as low illumination, image clutter, complex salient objects, and so on. To support the exploration for further research, each sample in UVT20K is annotated with a comprehensive set of ground truths, including saliency masks, scribbles, boundaries, and challenge attributes. In addition, we propose a Progressive Correlation Network (PCNet), which models inter- and intra-modal correlations on the basis of explicit alignment to achieve accurate predictions in unaligned image pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on unaligned and aligned datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Angknpng/PCNet.

- **Summary**: Object anomaly detection is essential for industrial quality inspection, yet traditional single-sensor methods face critical limitations. They fail to capture the wide range of anomaly types, as single sensors are often constrained to either external appearance, geometric structure, or internal properties. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MulSen-AD, the first high-resolution, multi-sensor anomaly detection dataset tailored for industrial applications. MulSen-AD unifies data from RGB cameras, laser scanners, and lock-in infrared thermography, effectively capturing external appearance, geometric deformations, and internal defects. The dataset spans 15 industrial products with diverse, real-world anomalies. We also present MulSen-AD Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate multi-sensor methods, and propose MulSen-TripleAD, a decision-level fusion algorithm that integrates these three modalities for robust, unsupervised object anomaly detection. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-sensor fusion substantially outperforms single-sensor approaches, achieving 96.1% AUROC in object-level detection accuracy. These results highlight the importance of integrating multi-sensor data for comprehensive industrial anomaly detection.

- **Summary**: Open-set object detection (OSOD) is highly desirable for robotic manipulation in unstructured environments. However, existing OSOD methods often fail to meet the requirements of robotic applications due to their high computational burden and complex deployment. To address this issue, this paper proposes a light-weight framework called Decoupled OSOD (DOSOD), which is a practical and highly efficient solution to support real-time OSOD tasks in robotic systems. Specifically, DOSOD builds upon the YOLO-World pipeline by integrating a vision-language model (VLM) with a detector. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) adaptor is developed to transform text embeddings extracted by the VLM into a joint space, within which the detector learns the region representations of class-agnostic proposals. Cross-modality features are directly aligned in the joint space, avoiding the complex feature interactions and thereby improving computational efficiency. DOSOD operates like a traditional closed-set detector during the testing phase, effectively bridging the gap between closed-set and open-set detection. Compared to the baseline YOLO-World, the proposed DOSOD significantly enhances real-time performance while maintaining comparable accuracy. The slight DOSOD-S model achieves a Fixed AP of $26.7\%$, compared to $26.2\%$ for YOLO-World-v1-S and $22.7\%$ for YOLO-World-v2-S, using similar backbones on the LVIS minival dataset. Meanwhile, the FPS of DOSOD-S is $57.1\%$ higher than YOLO-World-v1-S and $29.6\%$ higher than YOLO-World-v2-S. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the DOSOD model facilitates the deployment of edge devices. The codes and models are publicly available at https://github.com/D-Robotics-AI-Lab/DOSOD.

- **Summary**: 3D scene understanding is an important task, and there has been a recent surge of research interest in aligning 3D representations of point clouds with text to empower embodied AI. However, due to the lack of comprehensive 3D benchmarks, the capabilities of 3D models in real-world scenes, particularly those that are challenging with subtly distinguished objects, remain insufficiently investigated. To facilitate a more thorough evaluation of 3D models' capabilities, we propose a scheme, ObjVariantEnsemble, to systematically introduce more scenes with specified object classes, colors, shapes, quantities, and spatial relationships to meet model evaluation needs. More importantly, we intentionally construct scenes with similar objects to a certain degree and design an LLM-VLM-cooperated annotator to capture key distinctions as annotations. The resultant benchmark can better challenge 3D models, reveal their shortcomings in understanding, and potentially aid in the further development of 3D models.

- **Summary**: The sensing and manipulation of transparent objects present a critical challenge in industrial and laboratory robotics. Conventional sensors face challenges in obtaining the full depth of transparent objects due to the refraction and reflection of light on their surfaces and their lack of visible texture. Previous research has attempted to obtain complete depth maps of transparent objects from RGB and damaged depth maps (collected by depth sensor) using deep learning models. However, existing methods fail to fully utilize the original depth map, resulting in limited accuracy for deep completion. To solve this problem, we propose TDCNet, a novel dual-branch CNN-Transformer parallel network for transparent object depth completion. The proposed framework consists of two different branches: one extracts features from partial depth maps, while the other processes RGB-D images. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple public datasets. Our code and the pre-trained model are publicly available at https://github.com/XianghuiFan/TDCNet.

- **Summary**: The acquisition of substantial volumes of 3D articulated object data is expensive and time-consuming, and consequently the scarcity of 3D articulated object data becomes an obstacle for deep learning methods to achieve remarkable performance in various articulated object understanding tasks. Meanwhile, pairing these object data with detailed annotations to enable training for various tasks is also difficult and labor-intensive to achieve. In order to expeditiously gather a significant number of 3D articulated objects with comprehensive and detailed annotations for training, we propose Articulated Object Procedural Generation toolbox, a.k.a. Arti-PG toolbox. Arti-PG toolbox consists of i) descriptions of articulated objects by means of a generalized structure program along with their analytic correspondence to the objects' point cloud, ii) procedural rules about manipulations on the structure program to synthesize large-scale and diverse new articulated objects, and iii) mathematical descriptions of knowledge (e.g. affordance, semantics, etc.) to provide annotations to the synthesized object. Arti-PG has two appealing properties for providing training data for articulated object understanding tasks: i) objects are created with unlimited variations in shape through program-oriented structure manipulation, ii) Arti-PG is widely applicable to diverse tasks by easily providing comprehensive and detailed annotations. Arti-PG now supports the procedural generation of 26 categories of articulate objects and provides annotations across a wide range of both vision and manipulation tasks, and we provide exhaustive experiments which fully demonstrate its advantages. We will make Arti-PG toolbox publicly available for the community to use.

- **Summary**: Object-centric architectures can learn to extract distinct object representations from visual scenes, enabling downstream applications on the object level. Similarly to autoencoder-based image models, object-centric approaches have been trained on the unsupervised reconstruction loss of images encoded by RGB color spaces. In our work, we challenge the common assumption that RGB images are the optimal color space for unsupervised learning in computer vision. We discuss conceptually and empirically that other color spaces, such as HSV, bear essential characteristics for object-centric representation learning, like robustness to lighting conditions. We further show that models improve when requiring them to predict additional color channels. Specifically, we propose to transform the predicted targets to the RGB-S space, which extends RGB with HSV's saturation component and leads to markedly better reconstruction and disentanglement for five common evaluation datasets. The use of composite color spaces can be implemented with basically no computational overhead, is agnostic of the models' architecture, and is universally applicable across a wide range of visual computing tasks and training types. The findings of our approach encourage additional investigations in computer vision tasks beyond object-centric learning.

- **Summary**: With the advancement of deep learning methods it is imperative that autonomous systems will increasingly become intelligent with the inclusion of advanced machine learning algorithms to execute a variety of autonomous operations. One such task involves the design and evaluation for a subsystem of the perception system for object detection and tracking. The challenge in the creation of software to solve the task is in discovering the need for a dataset, annotation of the dataset, selection of features, integration and refinement of existing algorithms, while evaluating performance metrics through training and testing. This research effort focuses on the development of a machine learning pipeline emphasizing the inclusion of assurance methods with increasing automation. In the process, a new dataset was created by collecting videos of moving object such as Roomba vacuum cleaner, emulating search and rescue (SAR) for indoor environment. Individual frames were extracted from the videos and labeled using a combination of manual and automated techniques. This annotated dataset was refined for accuracy by initially training it on YOLOv4. After the refinement of the dataset it was trained on a second YOLOv4 and a Mask R-CNN model, which is deployed on a Parrot Mambo drone to perform real-time object detection and tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the models in accurately detecting and tracking the Roomba across multiple trials, achieving an average loss of 0.1942 and 96% accuracy.
