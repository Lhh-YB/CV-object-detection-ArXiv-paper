- **Summary**: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to locate human-object pairs and identify their interaction categories in images. Most existing methods primarily focus on supervised learning, which relies on extensive manual HOI annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, termed Knowledge Integration to HOI (KI2HOI), that effectively integrates the knowledge of visual-language model to improve zero-shot HOI detection. Specifically, the verb feature learning module is designed based on visual semantics, by employing the verb extraction decoder to convert corresponding verb queries into interaction-specific category representations. We develop an effective additive self-attention mechanism to generate more comprehensive visual representations. Moreover, the innovative interaction representation decoder effectively extracts informative regions by integrating spatial and visual feature information through a cross-attention mechanism. To deal with zero-shot learning in low-data, we leverage a priori knowledge from the CLIP text encoder to initialize the linear classifier for enhanced interaction understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on the mainstream HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the previous methods in various zero-shot and full-supervised settings.

- **Summary**: Sparse 3D detectors have received significant attention since the query-based paradigm embraces low latency without explicit dense BEV feature construction. However, these detectors achieve worse performance than their dense counterparts. In this paper, we find the key to bridging the performance gap is to enhance the awareness of rich representations in two modalities. Here, we present a high-performance fully sparse detector for end-to-end multi-modality 3D object detection. The detector, termed SparseLIF, contains three key designs, which are (1) Perspective-Aware Query Generation (PAQG) to generate high-quality 3D queries with perspective priors, (2) RoI-Aware Sampling (RIAS) to further refine prior queries by sampling RoI features from each modality, (3) Uncertainty-Aware Fusion (UAF) to precisely quantify the uncertainty of each sensor modality and adaptively conduct final multi-modality fusion, thus achieving great robustness against sensor noises. By the time of paper submission, SparseLIF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, ranking 1st on both validation set and test benchmark, outperforming all state-of-the-art 3D object detectors by a notable margin.

- **Summary**: Recent 3D object detectors typically utilize multi-sensor data and unify multi-modal features in the shared bird's-eye view (BEV) representation space. However, our empirical findings indicate that previous methods have limitations in generating fusion BEV features free from cross-modal conflicts. These conflicts encompass extrinsic conflicts caused by BEV feature construction and inherent conflicts stemming from heterogeneous sensor signals. Therefore, we propose a novel Eliminating Conflicts Fusion (ECFusion) method to explicitly eliminate the extrinsic/inherent conflicts in BEV space and produce improved multi-modal BEV features. Specifically, we devise a Semantic-guided Flow-based Alignment (SFA) module to resolve extrinsic conflicts via unifying spatial distribution in BEV space before fusion. Moreover, we design a Dissolved Query Recovering (DQR) mechanism to remedy inherent conflicts by preserving objectness clues that are lost in the fusion BEV feature. In general, our method maximizes the effective information utilization of each modality and leverages inter-modal complementarity. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the highly competitive nuScenes 3D object detection dataset. The code is released at https://github.com/fjhzhixi/ECFusion.

- **Summary**: Event-based moving object detection is a challenging task, where static background and moving object are mixed together. Typically, existing methods mainly align the background events to the same spatial coordinate system via motion compensation to distinguish the moving object. However, they neglect the potential spatial tailing effect of moving object events caused by excessive motion, which may affect the structure integrity of the extracted moving object. We discover that the moving object has a complete columnar structure in the point cloud composed of motion-compensated events along the timestamp. Motivated by this, we propose a novel joint spatio-temporal reasoning method for event-based moving object detection. Specifically, we first compensate the motion of background events using inertial measurement unit. In spatial reasoning stage, we project the compensated events into the same image coordinate, discretize the timestamp of events to obtain a time image that can reflect the motion confidence, and further segment the moving object through adaptive threshold on the time image. In temporal reasoning stage, we construct the events into a point cloud along timestamp, and use RANSAC algorithm to extract the columnar shape in the cloud for peeling off the background. Finally, we fuse the results from the two reasoning stages to extract the final moving object region. This joint spatio-temporal reasoning framework can effectively detect the moving object from motion confidence and geometric structure. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to verify that the proposed method can improve the moving object detection accuracy by 13\%.

- **Summary**: Three-Dimensional (3D) dense captioning is an emerging vision-language bridging task that aims to generate multiple detailed and accurate descriptions for 3D scenes. It presents significant potential and challenges due to its closer representation of the real world compared to 2D visual captioning, as well as complexities in data collection and processing of 3D point cloud sources. Despite the popularity and success of existing methods, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys summarizing the advancements in this field, which hinders its progress. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of 3D dense captioning, covering task definition, architecture classification, dataset analysis, evaluation metrics, and in-depth prosperity discussions. Based on a synthesis of previous literature, we refine a standard pipeline that serves as a common paradigm for existing methods. We also introduce a clear taxonomy of existing models, summarize technologies involved in different modules, and conduct detailed experiment analysis. Instead of a chronological order introduction, we categorize the methods into different classes to facilitate exploration and analysis of the differences and connections among existing techniques. We also provide a reading guideline to assist readers with different backgrounds and purposes in reading efficiently. Furthermore, we propose a series of promising future directions for 3D dense captioning by identifying challenges and aligning them with the development of related tasks, offering valuable insights and inspiring future research in this field. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of 3D dense captioning, foster further investigations, and contribute to the development of novel applications in multimedia and related domains.

- **Summary**: Object counting is a challenging task with broad application prospects in security surveillance, traffic management, and disease diagnosis. Existing object counting methods face a tri-fold challenge: achieving superior performance, maintaining high generalizability, and minimizing annotation costs. We develop a novel training-free class-agnostic object counter, TFCounter, which is prompt-context-aware via the cascade of the essential elements in large-scale foundation models. This approach employs an iterative counting framework with a dual prompt system to recognize a broader spectrum of objects varying in shape, appearance, and size. Besides, it introduces an innovative context-aware similarity module incorporating background context to enhance accuracy within messy scenes. To demonstrate cross-domain generalizability, we collect a novel counting dataset named BIKE-1000, including exclusive 1000 images of shared bicycles from Meituan. Extensive experiments on FSC-147, CARPK, and BIKE-1000 datasets demonstrate that TFCounter outperforms existing leading training-free methods and exhibits competitive results compared to trained counterparts.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we introduce VoteCut, an innovative method for unsupervised object discovery that leverages feature representations from multiple self-supervised models. VoteCut employs normalized-cut based graph partitioning, clustering and a pixel voting approach. Additionally, We present CuVLER (Cut-Vote-and-LEaRn), a zero-shot model, trained using pseudo-labels, generated by VoteCut, and a novel soft target loss to refine segmentation accuracy. Through rigorous evaluations across multiple datasets and several unsupervised setups, our methods demonstrate significant improvements in comparison to previous state-of-the-art models. Our ablation studies further highlight the contributions of each component, revealing the robustness and efficacy of our approach. Collectively, VoteCut and CuVLER pave the way for future advancements in image segmentation.

- **Summary**: The estimation of 6D object poses is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications. Particularly, in high risk scenarios such as human-robot interaction, industrial inspection, and automation, reliable pose estimates are crucial. In the last years, increasingly accurate and robust deep-learning-based approaches for 6D object pose estimation have been proposed. Many top-performing methods are not end-to-end trainable but consist of multiple stages. In the context of deep uncertainty quantification, deep ensembles are considered as state of the art since they have been proven to produce well-calibrated and robust uncertainty estimates. However, deep ensembles can only be applied to methods that can be trained end-to-end. In this work, we propose a method to quantify the uncertainty of multi-stage 6D object pose estimation approaches with deep ensembles. For the implementation, we choose SurfEmb as representative, since it is one of the top-performing 6D object pose estimation approaches in the BOP Challenge 2022. We apply established metrics and concepts for deep uncertainty quantification to evaluate the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel uncertainty calibration score for regression tasks to quantify the quality of the estimated uncertainty.

- **Summary**: This work addresses the Brain Magnetic Resonance Image Synthesis for Tumor Segmentation (BraSyn) challenge, which was hosted as part of the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge in 2023. In this challenge, researchers are invited to synthesize a missing magnetic resonance image sequence, given other available sequences, to facilitate tumor segmentation pipelines trained on complete sets of image sequences. This problem can be tackled using deep learning within the framework of paired image-to-image translation. In this study, we propose investigating the effectiveness of a commonly used deep learning framework, such as Pix2Pix, trained under the supervision of different image-quality loss functions. Our results indicate that the use of different loss functions significantly affects the synthesis quality. We systematically study the impact of various loss functions in the multi-sequence MR image synthesis setting of the BraSyn challenge. Furthermore, we demonstrate how image synthesis performance can be optimized by combining different learning objectives beneficially.

- **Summary**: Aedes aegypti is still one of the main concerns when it comes to disease vectors. Among the many ways to deal with it, there are important protocols that make use of egg numbers in ovitraps to calculate indices, such as the LIRAa and the Breteau Index, which can provide information on predictable outbursts and epidemics. Also, there are many research lines that require egg numbers, specially when mass production of mosquitoes is needed. Egg counting is a laborious and error-prone task that can be automated via computer vision-based techniques, specially deep learning-based counting with object detection. In this work, we propose a new dataset comprising field and laboratory eggs, along with test results of three neural networks applied to the task: Faster R-CNN, Side-Aware Boundary Localization and FoveaBox.

- **Comment**: Preprint submitted to Pattern Recognition
- **Journal**: None
- **Summary**: We propose a novel Transformer-based module to address the data association problem for multi-object tracking. From detections obtained by a pretrained detector, this module uses only coordinates from bounding boxes to estimate an affinity score between pairs of tracks extracted from two distinct temporal windows. This module, named TWiX, is trained on sets of tracks with the objective of discriminating pairs of tracks coming from the same object from those which are not. Our module does not use the intersection over union measure, nor does it requires any motion priors or any camera motion compensation technique. By inserting TWiX within an online cascade matching pipeline, our tracker C-TWiX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DanceTrack and KITTIMOT datasets, and gets competitive results on the MOT17 dataset. The code will be made available upon publication.

- **Summary**: Task-oriented object detection aims to find objects suitable for accomplishing specific tasks. As a challenging task, it requires simultaneous visual data processing and reasoning under ambiguous semantics. Recent solutions are mainly all-in-one models. However, the object detection backbones are pre-trained without text supervision. Thus, to incorporate task requirements, their intricate models undergo extensive learning on a highly imbalanced and scarce dataset, resulting in capped performance, laborious training, and poor generalizability. In contrast, we propose TaskCLIP, a more natural two-stage design composed of general object detection and task-guided object selection. Particularly for the latter, we resort to the recently successful large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as our backbone, which provides rich semantic knowledge and a uniform embedding space for images and texts. Nevertheless, the naive application of VLMs leads to sub-optimal quality, due to the misalignment between embeddings of object images and their visual attributes, which are mainly adjective phrases. To this end, we design a transformer-based aligner after the pre-trained VLMs to re-calibrate both embeddings. Finally, we employ a trainable score function to post-process the VLM matching results for object selection. Experimental results demonstrate that our TaskCLIP outperforms the state-of-the-art DETR-based model TOIST by 3.5% and only requires a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 for both training and inference.
