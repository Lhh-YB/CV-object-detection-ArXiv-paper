- **Summary**: A cognitive function of tracking multiple objects, needed in autonomous mobile vehicles, comprises object detection and their temporal association. While great progress owing to machine learning has been recently seen for elaborating the similarity matrix between the objects that have been recognized and the objects detected in a current video frame, less for the assignment problem that finally determines the temporal association, which is a combinatorial optimization problem. Here we show an in-vehicle multiple object tracking system with a flexible assignment function for tracking through multiple long-term occlusion events. To solve the flexible assignment problem formulated as a nondeterministic polynomial time-hard problem, the system relies on an embeddable Ising machine based on a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation. Using a vehicle-mountable computing platform, we demonstrate a realtime system-wide throughput (23 frames per second on average) with the enhanced functionality.

- **Summary**: In recent years, personalized diffusion-based text-to-image generative tasks have been a hot topic in computer vision studies. A robust diffusion model is determined by its ability to perform near-perfect reconstruction of certain product outcomes given few related input samples. Unfortunately, the current prominent diffusion-based finetuning technique falls short in maintaining the foreground object consistency while being constrained to produce diverse backgrounds in the image outcome. In the worst scenario, the overfitting issue may occur, meaning that the foreground object is less controllable due to the condition above, for example, the input prompt information is transferred ambiguously to both foreground and background regions, instead of the supposed background region only. To tackle the issues above, we proposed Hypnos, a highly precise foreground-focused diffusion finetuning technique. On the image level, this strategy works best for inanimate object generation tasks, and to do so, Hypnos implements two main approaches, namely: (i) a content-centric prompting strategy and (ii) the utilization of our additional foreground-focused discriminative module. The utilized module is connected with the diffusion model and finetuned with our proposed set of supervision mechanism. Combining the strategies above yielded to the foreground-background disentanglement capability of the diffusion model. Our experimental results showed that the proposed strategy gave a more robust performance and visually pleasing results compared to the former technique. For better elaborations, we also provided extensive studies to assess the fruitful outcomes above, which reveal how personalization behaves in regard to several training conditions.

- **Summary**: Reconstructing a complete object from its parts is a fundamental problem in many scientific domains. The purpose of this article is to provide a systematic survey on this topic. The reassembly problem requires understanding the attributes of individual pieces and establishing matches between different pieces. Many approaches also model priors of the underlying complete object. Existing approaches are tightly connected problems of shape segmentation, shape matching, and learning shape priors. We provide existing algorithms in this context and emphasize their similarities and differences to general-purpose approaches. We also survey the trends from early non-deep learning approaches to more recent deep learning approaches. In addition to algorithms, this survey will also describe existing datasets, open-source software packages, and applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey on this topic in computer graphics.

- **Summary**: This paper describes a method to detect generic dynamic objects for automated driving. First, a LiDAR-based dynamic grid is generated online. Second, a deep learning-based detector is trained on the dynamic grid to infer the presence of dynamic objects of any type, which is a prerequisite for safe automated vehicles in arbitrary, edge-case scenarios. The Rotation-equivariant Detector (ReDet) - originally designed for oriented object detection on aerial images - was chosen due to its high detection performance. Experiments are conducted based on real sensor data and the benefits in comparison to classic dynamic cell clustering strategies are highlighted. The false positive object detection rate is strongly reduced by the proposed approach.
