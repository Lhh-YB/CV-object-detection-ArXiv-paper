- **Summary**: This paper explores the size-invariance of evaluation metrics in Salient Object Detection (SOD), especially when multiple targets of diverse sizes co-exist in the same image. We observe that current metrics are size-sensitive, where larger objects are focused, and smaller ones tend to be ignored. We argue that the evaluation should be size-invariant because bias based on size is unjustified without additional semantic information. In pursuit of this, we propose a generic approach that evaluates each salient object separately and then combines the results, effectively alleviating the imbalance. We further develop an optimization framework tailored to this goal, achieving considerable improvements in detecting objects of different sizes. Theoretically, we provide evidence supporting the validity of our new metrics and present the generalization analysis of SOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

- **Summary**: The study of astronomical phenomena through ground-based observations is always challenged by the distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere. Traditional methods of post-facto image correction, essential for correcting these distortions, often rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their effectiveness, particularly in the presence of spatially variant atmospheric turbulence. Such cases are often solved by partitioning the field-of-view into small patches, deconvolving each patch independently, and merging all patches together. This approach is often inefficient and can produce artifacts. Recent advancements in computational techniques and the advent of deep learning offer new pathways to address these limitations. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging a deep neural network to emulate spatially variant convolutions, offering a breakthrough in the efficiency and accuracy of astronomical image deconvolution. By training on a dataset of images convolved with spatially invariant point spread functions and validating its generalizability to spatially variant conditions, this approach presents a significant advancement over traditional methods. The convolution emulator is used as a forward model in a multi-object multi-frame blind deconvolution algorithm for solar images. The emulator enables the deconvolution of solar observations across large fields of view without resorting to patch-wise mosaicking, thus avoiding artifacts associated with such techniques. This method represents a significant computational advantage, reducing processing times by orders of magnitude.

- **Summary**: Most existing attention prediction research focuses on salient instances like humans and objects. However, the more complex interaction-oriented attention, arising from the comprehension of interactions between instances by human observers, remains largely unexplored. This is equally crucial for advancing human-machine interaction and human-centered artificial intelligence. To bridge this gap, we first collect a novel gaze fixation dataset named IG, comprising 530,000 fixation points across 740 diverse interaction categories, capturing visual attention during human observers cognitive processes of interactions. Subsequently, we introduce the zero-shot interaction-oriented attention prediction task ZeroIA, which challenges models to predict visual cues for interactions not encountered during training. Thirdly, we present the Interactive Attention model IA, designed to emulate human observers cognitive processes to tackle the ZeroIA problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IA outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in both ZeroIA and fully supervised settings. Lastly, we endeavor to apply interaction-oriented attention to the interaction recognition task itself. Further experimental results demonstrate the promising potential to enhance the performance and interpretability of existing state-of-the-art HOI models by incorporating real human attention data from IG and attention labels generated by IA.

- **Summary**: Bounding box regression is one of the important steps of object detection. However, rotation detectors often involve a more complicated loss based on SkewIoU which is unfriendly to gradient-based training. Most of the existing loss functions for rotated object detection calculate the difference between two bounding boxes only focus on the deviation of area or each points distance (e.g., $\mathcal{L}_{Smooth-\ell 1}$, $\mathcal{L}_{RotatedIoU}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{PIoU}$). The calculation process of some loss functions is extremely complex (e.g. $\mathcal{L}_{KFIoU}$). In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of bounding box regression for rotated object detection, we proposed a novel metric for arbitrary shapes comparison based on minimum points distance, which takes most of the factors from existing loss functions for rotated object detection into account, i.e., the overlap or nonoverlapping area, the central points distance and the rotation angle. We also proposed a loss function called $\mathcal{L}_{FPDIoU}$ based on four points distance for accurate bounding box regression focusing on faster and high quality anchor boxes. In the experiments, $FPDIoU$ loss has been applied to state-of-the-art rotated object detection (e.g., RTMDET, H2RBox) models training with three popular benchmarks of rotated object detection including DOTA, DIOR, HRSC2016 and two benchmarks of arbitrary orientation scene text detection including ICDAR 2017 RRC-MLT and ICDAR 2019 RRC-MLT, which achieves better performance than existing loss functions.

- **Summary**: Due to the significant advances in large-scale text-to-image generation by diffusion model (DM), controllable human image generation has been attracting much attention recently. Existing works, such as Controlnet [36], T2I-adapter [20] and HumanSD [10] have demonstrated good abilities in generating human images based on pose conditions, they still fail to meet the requirements of real e-commerce scenarios. These include (1) the interaction between the shown product and human should be considered, (2) human parts like face/hand/arm/foot and the interaction between human model and product should be hyper-realistic, and (3) the identity of the product shown in advertising should be exactly consistent with the product itself. To this end, in this paper, we first define a new human image generation task for e-commerce marketing, i.e., Object-ID-retentive Human-object Interaction image Generation (OHG), and then propose a VirtualModel framework to generate human images for product shown, which supports displays of any categories of products and any types of human-object interaction. As shown in Figure 1, VirtualModel not only outperforms other methods in terms of accurate pose control and image quality but also allows for the display of user-specified product objects by maintaining the product-ID consistency and enhancing the plausibility of human-object interaction. Codes and data will be released.

- **Summary**: Automated medical image analysis systems often require large amounts of training data with high quality labels, which are difficult and time consuming to generate. This paper introduces Radiology Object in COntext version 2 (ROCOv2), a multimodal dataset consisting of radiological images and associated medical concepts and captions extracted from the PMC Open Access subset. It is an updated version of the ROCO dataset published in 2018, and adds 35,705 new images added to PMC since 2018. It further provides manually curated concepts for imaging modalities with additional anatomical and directional concepts for X-rays. The dataset consists of 79,789 images and has been used, with minor modifications, in the concept detection and caption prediction tasks of ImageCLEFmedical Caption 2023. The dataset is suitable for training image annotation models based on image-caption pairs, or for multi-label image classification using Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts provided with each image. In addition, it can serve for pre-training of medical domain models, and evaluation of deep learning models for multi-task learning.

- **Summary**: Open-vocabulary object detection (OvOD) has transformed detection into a language-guided task, empowering users to freely define their class vocabularies of interest during inference. However, our initial investigation indicates that existing OvOD detectors exhibit significant variability when dealing with vocabularies across various semantic granularities, posing a concern for real-world deployment. To this end, we introduce Semantic Hierarchy Nexus (SHiNe), a novel classifier that uses semantic knowledge from class hierarchies. It runs offline in three steps: i) it retrieves relevant super-/sub-categories from a hierarchy for each target class; ii) it integrates these categories into hierarchy-aware sentences; iii) it fuses these sentence embeddings to generate the nexus classifier vector. Our evaluation on various detection benchmarks demonstrates that SHiNe enhances robustness across diverse vocabulary granularities, achieving up to +31.9% mAP50 with ground truth hierarchies, while retaining improvements using hierarchies generated by large language models. Moreover, when applied to open-vocabulary classification on ImageNet-1k, SHiNe improves the CLIP zero-shot baseline by +2.8% accuracy. SHiNe is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated with any off-the-shelf OvOD detector, without incurring additional computational overhead during inference. The code is open source.



### SpecDETR: A Transformer-based Hyperspectral Point Object Detection Network

- **Summary**: Hyperspectral target detection (HTD) aims to identify specific materials based on spectral information in hyperspectral imagery and can detect point targets, some of which occupy a smaller than one-pixel area. However, existing HTD methods are developed based on per-pixel binary classification, which limits the feature representation capability for point targets. In this paper, we rethink the hyperspectral point target detection from the object detection perspective, and focus more on the object-level prediction capability rather than the pixel classification capability. Inspired by the token-based processing flow of Detection Transformer (DETR), we propose the first specialized network for hyperspectral multi-class point object detection, SpecDETR. Without the backbone part of the current object detection framework, SpecDETR treats the spectral features of each pixel in hyperspectral images as a token and utilizes a multi-layer Transformer encoder with local and global coordination attention modules to extract deep spatial-spectral joint features. SpecDETR regards point object detection as a one-to-many set prediction problem, thereby achieving a concise and efficient DETR decoder that surpasses the current state-of-the-art DETR decoder in terms of parameters and accuracy in point object detection. We develop a simulated hyperSpectral Point Object Detection benchmark termed SPOD, and for the first time, evaluate and compare the performance of current object detection networks and HTD methods on hyperspectral multi-class point object detection. SpecDETR demonstrates superior performance as compared to current object detection networks and HTD methods on the SPOD dataset. Additionally, we validate on a public HTD dataset that by using data simulation instead of manual annotation, SpecDETR can detect real-world single-spectral point objects directly.

- **Summary**: This paper introduces Grounding DINO 1.5, a suite of advanced open-set object detection models developed by IDEA Research, which aims to advance the "Edge" of open-set object detection. The suite encompasses two models: Grounding DINO 1.5 Pro, a high-performance model designed for stronger generalization capability across a wide range of scenarios, and Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, an efficient model optimized for faster speed demanded in many applications requiring edge deployment. The Grounding DINO 1.5 Pro model advances its predecessor by scaling up the model architecture, integrating an enhanced vision backbone, and expanding the training dataset to over 20 million images with grounding annotations, thereby achieving a richer semantic understanding. The Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge model, while designed for efficiency with reduced feature scales, maintains robust detection capabilities by being trained on the same comprehensive dataset. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of Grounding DINO 1.5, with the Grounding DINO 1.5 Pro model attaining a 54.3 AP on the COCO detection benchmark and a 55.7 AP on the LVIS-minival zero-shot transfer benchmark, setting new records for open-set object detection. Furthermore, the Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge model, when optimized with TensorRT, achieves a speed of 75.2 FPS while attaining a zero-shot performance of 36.2 AP on the LVIS-minival benchmark, making it more suitable for edge computing scenarios. Model examples and demos with API will be released at https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounding-DINO-1.5-API

- **Summary**: Single object tracking is a vital task of many applications in critical fields. However, it is still considered one of the most challenging vision tasks. In recent years, computer vision, especially object tracking, witnessed the introduction or adoption of many novel techniques, setting new fronts for performance. In this survey, we visit some of the cutting-edge techniques in vision, such as Sequence Models, Generative Models, Self-supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Meta-Learning, Continual Learning, and Domain Adaptation, focusing on their application in single object tracking. We propose a novel categorization of single object tracking methods based on novel techniques and trends. Also, we conduct a comparative analysis of the performance reported by the methods presented on popular tracking benchmarks. Moreover, we analyze the pros and cons of the presented approaches and present a guide for non-traditional techniques in single object tracking. Finally, we suggest potential avenues for future research in single-object tracking.

- **Summary**: Locating an object in a sequence of frames, given its appearance in the first frame of the sequence, is a hard problem that involves many stages. Usually, state-of-the-art methods focus on bringing novel ideas in the visual encoding or relational modelling phases. However, in this work, we show that bounding box regression from learned joint search and template features is of high importance as well. While previous methods relied heavily on well-learned features representing interactions between search and template, we hypothesize that the receptive field of the input convolutional bounding box network plays an important role in accurately determining the object location. To this end, we introduce two novel bounding box regression networks: inception and deformable. Experiments and ablation studies show that our inception module installed on the recent ODTrack outperforms the latter on three benchmarks: the GOT-10k, the UAV123 and the OTB2015.
