- **Summary**: With the advancement of video analysis technology, the multi-object tracking (MOT) problem in complex scenes involving pedestrians is gaining increasing importance. This challenge primarily involves two key tasks: pedestrian detection and re-identification. While significant progress has been achieved in pedestrian detection tasks in recent years, enhancing the effectiveness of re-identification tasks remains a persistent challenge. This difficulty arises from the large total number of pedestrian samples in multi-object tracking datasets and the scarcity of individual instance samples. Motivated by recent rapid advancements in meta-learning techniques, we introduce MAML MOT, a meta-learning-based training approach for multi-object tracking. This approach leverages the rapid learning capability of meta-learning to tackle the issue of sample scarcity in pedestrian re-identification tasks, aiming to improve the model's generalization performance and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy on mainstream datasets in the MOT Challenge. This offers new perspectives and solutions for research in the field of pedestrian multi-object tracking.

- **Summary**: We present SLIP (SAM+CLIP), an enhanced architecture for zero-shot object segmentation. SLIP combines the Segment Anything Model (SAM) \cite{kirillov2023segment} with the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) \cite{radford2021learning}. By incorporating text prompts into SAM using CLIP, SLIP enables object segmentation without prior training on specific classes or categories. We fine-tune CLIP on a Pokemon dataset, allowing it to learn meaningful image-text representations. SLIP demonstrates the ability to recognize and segment objects in images based on contextual information from text prompts, expanding the capabilities of SAM for versatile object segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the SLIP architecture in segmenting objects in images based on textual cues. The integration of CLIP's text-image understanding capabilities into SAM expands the capabilities of the original architecture and enables more versatile and context-aware object segmentation.
