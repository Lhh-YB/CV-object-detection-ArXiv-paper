- **Summary**: The demand for accurate object detection in aerial imagery has surged with the widespread use of drones and satellite technology. Traditional object detection models, trained on datasets biased towards large objects, struggle to perform optimally in aerial scenarios where small, densely clustered objects are prevalent. To address this challenge, we present an innovative approach that combines super-resolution and an adapted lightweight YOLOv5 architecture. We employ a range of datasets, including VisDrone-2023, SeaDroneSee, VEDAI, and NWPU VHR-10, to evaluate our model's performance. Our Super Resolved YOLOv5 architecture features Transformer encoder blocks, allowing the model to capture global context and context information, leading to improved detection results, especially in high-density, occluded conditions. This lightweight model not only delivers improved accuracy but also ensures efficient resource utilization, making it well-suited for real-time applications. Our experimental results demonstrate the model's superior performance in detecting small and densely clustered objects, underlining the significance of dataset choice and architectural adaptation for this specific task. In particular, the method achieves 52.5% mAP on VisDrone, exceeding top prior works. This approach promises to significantly advance object detection in aerial imagery, contributing to more accurate and reliable results in a variety of real-world applications.
