- **Summary**: Camera and LiDAR serve as informative sensors for accurate and robust autonomous driving systems. However, these sensors often exhibit heterogeneous natures, resulting in distributional modality gaps that present significant challenges for fusion. To address this, a robust fusion technique is crucial, particularly for enhancing 3D object detection. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic adjustment technology aimed at aligning modal distributions and learning effective modality representations to enhance the fusion process. Specifically, we propose a triphase domain aligning module. This module adjusts the feature distributions from both the camera and LiDAR, bringing them closer to the ground truth domain and minimizing differences. Additionally, we explore improved representation acquisition methods for dynamic fusion, which includes modal interaction and specialty enhancement. Finally, an adaptive learning technique that merges the semantics and geometry information for dynamical instance optimization. Extensive experiments in the nuScenes dataset present competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches. Our code will be released in the future.

- **Summary**: The Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation is a critical factor that directly impacts the 3D object detection performance, but the traditional BEV grid representation induces quadratic computational cost as the spatial resolution grows. To address this limitation, we present a new camera-based 3D object detector with high-resolution vector representation: VectorFormer. The presented high-resolution vector representation is combined with the lower-resolution BEV representation to efficiently exploit 3D geometry from multi-camera images at a high resolution through our two novel modules: vector scattering and gathering. To this end, the learned vector representation with richer scene contexts can serve as the decoding query for final predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in NDS and inference time. Furthermore, we investigate query-BEV-based methods incorporated with our proposed vector representation and observe a consistent performance improvement.

- **Summary**: Object-centric (OC) representations, which represent the state of a visual scene by modeling it as a composition of objects, have the potential to be used in various downstream tasks to achieve systematic compositional generalization and facilitate reasoning. However, these claims have not been thoroughly analyzed yet. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains from language to computer vision, marking them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a multitude of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 600 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.

- **Summary**: Automotive simulation can potentially compensate for a lack of training data in computer vision applications. However, there has been little to no image quality evaluation of automotive simulation and the impact of optical degradations on simulation is little explored. In this work, we investigate Virtual KITTI and the impact of applying variations of Gaussian blur on image sharpness. Furthermore, we consider object detection, a common computer vision application on three different state-of-the-art models, thus allowing us to characterize the relationship between object detection and sharpness. It was found that while image sharpness (MTF50) degrades from an average of 0.245cy/px to approximately 0.119cy/px; object detection performance stays largely robust within 0.58\%(Faster RCNN), 1.45\%(YOLOF) and 1.93\%(DETR) across all respective held-out test sets.

- **Summary**: Object detection is a pivotal task in computer vision that has received significant attention in previous years. Nonetheless, the capability of a detector to localise objects out of the training distribution remains unexplored. Whilst recent approaches in object-level out-of-distribution (OoD) detection heavily rely on class labels, such approaches contradict truly open-world scenarios where the class distribution is often unknown. In this context, anomaly detection focuses on detecting unseen instances rather than classifying detections as OoD. This work aims to bridge this gap by leveraging an open-world object detector and an OoD detector via virtual outlier synthesis. This is achieved by using the detector backbone features to first learn object pseudo-classes via self-supervision. These pseudo-classes serve as the basis for class-conditional virtual outlier sampling of anomalous features that are classified by an OoD head. Our approach empowers our overall object detector architecture to learn anomaly-aware feature representations without relying on class labels, hence enabling truly open-world object anomaly detection. Empirical validation of our approach demonstrates its effectiveness across diverse datasets encompassing various imaging modalities (visible, infrared, and X-ray). Moreover, our method establishes state-of-the-art performance on object-level anomaly detection, achieving an average recall score improvement of over 5.4% for natural images and 23.5% for a security X-ray dataset compared to the current approaches. In addition, our method detects anomalies in datasets where current approaches fail. Code available at https://github.com/KostadinovShalon/oln-ssos.

- **Summary**: Weakly supervised video object segmentation (WSVOS) enables the identification of segmentation maps without requiring an extensive training dataset of object masks, relying instead on coarse video labels indicating object presence. Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.

- **Summary**: The choice of representation plays a key role in self-driving. Bird's eye view (BEV) representations have shown remarkable performance in recent years. In this paper, we propose to learn object-centric representations in BEV to distill a complex scene into more actionable information for self-driving. We first learn to place objects into slots with a slot attention model on BEV sequences. Based on these object-centric representations, we then train a transformer to learn to drive as well as reason about the future of other vehicles. We found that object-centric slot representations outperform both scene-level and object-level approaches that use the exact attributes of objects. Slot representations naturally incorporate information about objects from their spatial and temporal context such as position, heading, and speed without explicitly providing it. Our model with slots achieves an increased completion rate of the provided routes and, consequently, a higher driving score, with a lower variance across multiple runs, affirming slots as a reliable alternative in object-centric approaches. Additionally, we validate our model's performance as a world model through forecasting experiments, demonstrating its capability to predict future slot representations accurately.
