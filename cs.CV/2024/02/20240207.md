- **Summary**: Single object tracking (SOT) is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with a wide range of applications, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, and robot navigation. The robustness of SOT faces two main challenges: tiny target and fast motion. These challenges are especially manifested in videos captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), where the target is usually far away from the camera and often with significant motion relative to the camera. To evaluate the robustness of SOT methods, we propose BioDrone -- the first bionic drone-based visual benchmark for SOT. Unlike existing UAV datasets, BioDrone features videos captured from a flapping-wing UAV system with a major camera shake due to its aerodynamics. BioDrone hence highlights the tracking of tiny targets with drastic changes between consecutive frames, providing a new robust vision benchmark for SOT. To date, BioDrone offers the largest UAV-based SOT benchmark with high-quality fine-grained manual annotations and automatically generates frame-level labels, designed for robust vision analyses. Leveraging our proposed BioDrone, we conduct a systematic evaluation of existing SOT methods, comparing the performance of 20 representative models and studying novel means of optimizing a SOTA method (KeepTrack KeepTrack) for robust SOT. Our evaluation leads to new baselines and insights for robust SOT. Moving forward, we hope that BioDrone will not only serve as a high-quality benchmark for robust SOT, but also invite future research into robust computer vision.

- **Summary**: Inspired by the outstanding zero-shot capability of vision language models (VLMs) in image classification tasks, open-vocabulary object detection has attracted increasing interest by distilling the broad VLM knowledge into detector training. However, most existing open-vocabulary detectors learn by aligning region embeddings with categorical labels (e.g., bicycle) only, disregarding the capability of VLMs on aligning visual embeddings with fine-grained text description of object parts (e.g., pedals and bells). This paper presents DVDet, a Descriptor-Enhanced Open Vocabulary Detector that introduces conditional context prompts and hierarchical textual descriptors that enable precise region-text alignment as well as open-vocabulary detection training in general. Specifically, the conditional context prompt transforms regional embeddings into image-like representations that can be directly integrated into general open vocabulary detection training. In addition, we introduce large language models as an interactive and implicit knowledge repository which enables iterative mining and refining visually oriented textual descriptors for precise region-text alignment. Extensive experiments over multiple large-scale benchmarks show that DVDet outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently by large margins.

- **Summary**: In this paper, we focus on a realistic yet challenging task, Single Domain Generalization Object Detection (S-DGOD), where only one source domain's data can be used for training object detectors, but have to generalize multiple distinct target domains. In S-DGOD, both high-capacity fitting and generalization abilities are needed due to the task's complexity. Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is known for its high capacity for complex data fitting and we propose to leverage Differentiable NAS to solve S-DGOD. However, it may confront severe over-fitting issues due to the feature imbalance phenomenon, where parameters optimized by gradient descent are biased to learn from the easy-to-learn features, which are usually non-causal and spuriously correlated to ground truth labels, such as the features of background in object detection data. Consequently, this leads to serious performance degradation, especially in generalizing to unseen target domains with huge domain gaps between the source domain and target domains. To address this issue, we propose the Generalizable loss (G-loss), which is an OoD-aware objective, preventing NAS from over-fitting by using gradient descent to optimize parameters not only on a subset of easy-to-learn features but also the remaining predictive features for generalization, and the overall framework is named G-NAS. Experimental results on the S-DGOD urban-scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed G-NAS achieves SOTA performance compared to baseline methods.

- **Summary**: Recent advances in machine learning have greatly benefited object detection and 6D pose estimation. However, textureless and metallic objects still pose a significant challenge due to few visual cues and the texture bias of CNNs. To address his issue, we propose a strategy for inducing a shape bias to CNN training. In particular, by randomizing textures applied to object surfaces during data rendering, we create training data without consistent textural cues. This methodology allows for seamless integration into existing data rendering engines, and results in negligible computational overhead for data rendering and network training. Our findings demonstrate that the shape bias we induce via randomized texturing, improves over existing approaches using style transfer. We evaluate with three detectors and two pose estimators. For the most recent object detector and for pose estimation in general, estimation accuracy improves for textureless and metallic objects. Additionally we show that our approach increases the pose estimation accuracy in the presence of image noise and strong illumination changes.

- **Summary**: Recent camera-based 3D object detection is limited by the precision of transforming from image to 3D feature spaces, as well as the accuracy of object localization within the 3D space. This paper aims to address such a fundamental problem of camera-based 3D object detection: How to effectively learn depth information for accurate feature lifting and object localization. Different from previous methods which directly predict depth distributions by using a supervised estimation model, we propose a cascade framework consisting of two depth-aware learning paradigms. First, a depth estimation (DE) scheme leverages relative depth information to realize the effective feature lifting from 2D to 3D spaces. Furthermore, a depth calibration (DC) scheme introduces depth reconstruction to further adjust the 3D object localization perturbation along the depth axis. In practice, the DE is explicitly realized by using both the absolute and relative depth optimization loss to promote the precision of depth prediction, while the capability of DC is implicitly embedded into the detection Transformer through a depth denoising mechanism in the training phase. The entire model training is accomplished through an end-to-end manner. We propose a baseline detector and evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal with +2.2%/+2.7% NDS/mAP improvements on NuScenes benchmark, and gain a comparable performance with 55.9%/45.7% NDS/mAP. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate its generality based on various detectors with about +2% NDS improvements.

- **Summary**: Current state-of-the-art 6d pose estimation is too compute intensive to be deployed on edge devices, such as Microsoft HoloLens (2) or Apple iPad, both used for an increasing number of augmented reality applications. The quality of AR is greatly dependent on its capabilities to detect and overlay geometry within the scene. We propose a synthetically trained client-server-based augmented reality application, demonstrating state-of-the-art object pose estimation of metallic and texture-less industry objects on edge devices. Synthetic data enables training without real photographs, i.e. for yet-to-be-manufactured objects. Our qualitative evaluation on an AR-assisted sorting task, and quantitative evaluation on both renderings, as well as real-world data recorded on HoloLens 2, sheds light on its real-world applicability.



### Language-Based Augmentation to Address Shortcut Learning in Object Goal Navigation

- **Summary**: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown great potential in enabling robots to find certain objects (e.g., `find a fridge') in environments like homes or schools. This task is known as Object-Goal Navigation (ObjectNav). DRL methods are predominantly trained and evaluated using environment simulators. Although DRL has shown impressive results, the simulators may be biased or limited. This creates a risk of shortcut learning, i.e., learning a policy tailored to specific visual details of training environments. We aim to deepen our understanding of shortcut learning in ObjectNav, its implications and propose a solution. We design an experiment for inserting a shortcut bias in the appearance of training environments. As a proof-of-concept, we associate room types to specific wall colors (e.g., bedrooms with green walls), and observe poor generalization of a state-of-the-art (SOTA) ObjectNav method to environments where this is not the case (e.g., bedrooms with blue walls). We find that shortcut learning is the root cause: the agent learns to navigate to target objects, by simply searching for the associated wall color of the target object's room. To solve this, we propose Language-Based (L-B) augmentation. Our key insight is that we can leverage the multimodal feature space of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to augment visual representations directly at the feature-level, requiring no changes to the simulator, and only an addition of one layer to the model. Where the SOTA ObjectNav method's success rate drops 69%, our proposal has only a drop of 23%.
