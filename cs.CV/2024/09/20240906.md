- **Summary**: The detection of fa\c{c}ade elements on buildings, such as doors, windows, balconies, air conditioning units, billboards, and glass curtain walls, is a critical step in automating the creation of Building Information Modeling (BIM). Yet, this field faces significant challenges, including the uneven distribution of fa\c{c}ade elements, the presence of small objects, and substantial background noise, which hamper detection accuracy. To address these issues, we develop the BFA-YOLO model and the BFA-3D dataset in this study. The BFA-YOLO model is an advanced architecture designed specifically for analyzing multi-view images of fa\c{c}ade attachments. It integrates three novel components: the Feature Balanced Spindle Module (FBSM) that tackles the issue of uneven object distribution; the Target Dynamic Alignment Task Detection Head (TDATH) that enhances the detection of small objects; and the Position Memory Enhanced Self-Attention Mechanism (PMESA), aimed at reducing the impact of background noise. These elements collectively enable BFA-YOLO to effectively address each challenge, thereby improving model robustness and detection precision. The BFA-3D dataset, offers multi-view images with precise annotations across a wide range of fa\c{c}ade attachment categories. This dataset is developed to address the limitations present in existing fa\c{c}ade detection datasets, which often feature a single perspective and insufficient category coverage. Through comparative analysis, BFA-YOLO demonstrated improvements of 1.8\% and 2.9\% in mAP$_{50}$ on the BFA-3D dataset and the public Fa\c{c}ade-WHU dataset, respectively, when compared to the baseline YOLOv8 model. These results highlight the superior performance of BFA-YOLO in fa\c{c}ade element detection and the advancement of intelligent BIM technologies.

- **Summary**: Existing datasets for 3D hand-object interaction are limited either in the data cardinality, data variations in interaction scenarios, or the quality of annotations. In this work, we present a comprehensive new training dataset for hand-object interaction called HOGraspNet. It is the only real dataset that captures full grasp taxonomies, providing grasp annotation and wide intraclass variations. Using grasp taxonomies as atomic actions, their space and time combinatorial can represent complex hand activities around objects. We select 22 rigid objects from the YCB dataset and 8 other compound objects using shape and size taxonomies, ensuring coverage of all hand grasp configurations. The dataset includes diverse hand shapes from 99 participants aged 10 to 74, continuous video frames, and a 1.5M RGB-Depth of sparse frames with annotations. It offers labels for 3D hand and object meshes, 3D keypoints, contact maps, and \emph{grasp labels}. Accurate hand and object 3D meshes are obtained by fitting the hand parametric model (MANO) and the hand implicit function (HALO) to multi-view RGBD frames, with the MoCap system only for objects. Note that HALO fitting does not require any parameter tuning, enabling scalability to the dataset's size with comparable accuracy to MANO. We evaluate HOGraspNet on relevant tasks: grasp classification and 3D hand pose estimation. The result shows performance variations based on grasp type and object class, indicating the potential importance of the interaction space captured by our dataset. The provided data aims at learning universal shape priors or foundation models for 3D hand-object interaction. Our dataset and code are available at https://hograspnet2024.github.io/.

- **Summary**: The Lightweight Integrated Tracking-Feature Extraction (LITE) paradigm is introduced as a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) approach. It enhances ReID-based trackers by eliminating inference, pre-processing, post-processing, and ReID model training costs. LITE uses real-time appearance features without compromising speed. By integrating appearance feature extraction directly into the tracking pipeline using standard CNN-based detectors such as YOLOv8m, LITE demonstrates significant performance improvements. The simplest implementation of LITE on top of classic DeepSORT achieves a HOTA score of 43.03% at 28.3 FPS on the MOT17 benchmark, making it twice as fast as DeepSORT on MOT17 and four times faster on the more crowded MOT20 dataset, while maintaining similar accuracy. Additionally, a new evaluation framework for tracking-by-detection approaches reveals that conventional trackers like DeepSORT remain competitive with modern state-of-the-art trackers when evaluated under fair conditions. The code will be available post-publication at https://github.com/Jumabek/LITE.

- **Summary**: Growing customer demand for smart solutions in robotics and augmented reality has attracted considerable attention to 3D object detection from point clouds. Yet, existing indoor datasets taken individually are too small and insufficiently diverse to train a powerful and general 3D object detection model. In the meantime, more general approaches utilizing foundation models are still inferior in quality to those based on supervised training for a specific task. In this work, we propose \ours{}, a simple yet effective 3D object detection model, which is trained on a mixture of indoor datasets and is capable of working in various indoor environments. By unifying different label spaces, \ours{} enables learning a strong representation across multiple datasets through a supervised joint training scheme. The proposed network architecture is built upon a vanilla transformer encoder, making it easy to run, customize and extend the prediction pipeline for practical use. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ours{} obtains significant gains over existing 3D object detection methods in 6 indoor benchmarks: ScanNet (+1.1 mAP50), ARKitScenes (+19.4 mAP25), S3DIS (+9.1 mAP50), MultiScan (+9.3 mAP50), 3RScan (+3.2 mAP50), and ScanNet++ (+2.7 mAP50).

- **Summary**: Accurate and robust LiDAR 3D object detection is essential for comprehensive scene understanding in autonomous driving. Despite its importance, LiDAR detection performance is limited by inherent constraints of point cloud data, particularly under conditions of extended distances and occlusions. Recently, temporal aggregation has been proven to significantly enhance detection accuracy by fusing multi-frame viewpoint information and enriching the spatial representation of objects. In this work, we introduce a novel LiDAR 3D object detection framework, namely LiSTM, to facilitate spatial-temporal feature learning with cross-frame motion forecasting information. We aim to improve the spatial-temporal interpretation capabilities of the LiDAR detector by incorporating a dynamic prior, generated from a non-learnable motion estimation model. Specifically, Motion-Guided Feature Aggregation (MGFA) is proposed to utilize the object trajectory from previous and future motion states to model spatial-temporal correlations into gaussian heatmap over a driving sequence. This motion-based heatmap then guides the temporal feature fusion, enriching the proposed object features. Moreover, we design a Dual Correlation Weighting Module (DCWM) that effectively facilitates the interaction between past and prospective frames through scene- and channel-wise feature abstraction. In the end, a cascade cross-attention-based decoder is employed to refine the 3D prediction. We have conducted experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets to demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior 3D detection performance with effective spatial-temporal feature learning.

- **Summary**: Compositing an object into an image involves multiple non-trivial sub-tasks such as object placement and scaling, color/lighting harmonization, viewpoint/geometry adjustment, and shadow/reflection generation. Recent generative image compositing methods leverage diffusion models to handle multiple sub-tasks at once. However, existing models face limitations due to their reliance on masking the original object during training, which constrains their generation to the input mask. Furthermore, obtaining an accurate input mask specifying the location and scale of the object in a new image can be highly challenging. To overcome such limitations, we define a novel problem of unconstrained generative object compositing, i.e., the generation is not bounded by the mask, and train a diffusion-based model on a synthesized paired dataset. Our first-of-its-kind model is able to generate object effects such as shadows and reflections that go beyond the mask, enhancing image realism. Additionally, if an empty mask is provided, our model automatically places the object in diverse natural locations and scales, accelerating the compositing workflow. Our model outperforms existing object placement and compositing models in various quality metrics and user studies.

- **Summary**: In this work, we focus on generating hand grasp over objects. Compared to previous works of generating hand poses with a given object, we aim to allow the generalization of both hand and object shapes by a single model. Our proposed method Multi-modal Grasp Diffusion (MGD) learns the prior and conditional posterior distribution of both modalities from heterogeneous data sources. Therefore it relieves the limitation of hand-object grasp datasets by leveraging the large-scale 3D object datasets. According to both qualitative and quantitative experiments, both conditional and unconditional generation of hand grasp achieve good visual plausibility and diversity. The proposed method also generalizes well to unseen object shapes. The code and weights will be available at \url{https://github.com/noahcao/mgd}.

- **Summary**: Effective point cloud processing is crucial to LiDARbased autonomous driving systems. The capability to understand features at multiple scales is required for object detection of intelligent vehicles, where road users may appear in different sizes. Recent methods focus on the design of the feature aggregation operators, which collect features at different scales from the encoder backbone and assign them to the points of interest. While efforts are made into the aggregation modules, the importance of how to fuse these multi-scale features has been overlooked. This leads to insufficient feature communication across scales. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Point Pyramid RCNN (POP-RCNN), a feature pyramid-based framework for 3D object detection on point clouds. POP-RCNN consists of a Point Pyramid Feature Enhancement (PPFE) module to establish connections across spatial scales and semantic depths for information exchange. The PPFE module effectively fuses multi-scale features for rich information without the increased complexity in feature aggregation. To remedy the impact of inconsistent point densities, a point density confidence module is deployed. This design integration enables the use of a lightweight feature aggregator, and the emphasis on both shallow and deep semantics, realising a detection framework for 3D object detection. With great adaptability, the proposed method can be applied to a variety of existing frameworks to increase feature richness, especially for long-distance detection. By adopting the PPFE in the voxel-based and point-voxel-based baselines, experimental results on KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset show that the proposed method achieves remarkable performance even with limited computational headroom.
