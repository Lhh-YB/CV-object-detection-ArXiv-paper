- **Summary**: In this paper, a new classification model based on covariance matrices is built in order to classify buried objects. The inputs of the proposed models are the hyperbola thumbnails obtained with a classical Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system. These thumbnails are then inputs to the first layers of a classical CNN, which then produces a covariance matrix using the outputs of the convolutional filters. Next, the covariance matrix is given to a network composed of specific layers to classify Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. We show in a large database that our approach outperform shallow networks designed for GPR data and conventional CNNs typically used in computer vision applications, particularly when the number of training data decreases and in the presence of mislabeled data. We also illustrate the interest of our models when training data and test sets are obtained from different weather modes or considerations.

- **Summary**: Salient object detection (SOD) has achieved substantial progress in recent years. In practical scenarios, compressed images (CI) serve as the primary medium for data transmission and storage. However, scant attention has been directed towards SOD for compressed images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we are dedicated to strictly benchmarking and analyzing CNN-based salient object detection on compressed images. To comprehensively study this issue, we meticulously establish various CI SOD datasets from existing public SOD datasets. Subsequently, we investigate representative CNN-based SOD methods, assessing their robustness on compressed images (approximately 2.64 million images). Importantly, our evaluation results reveal two key findings: 1) current state-of-the-art CNN-based SOD models, while excelling on clean images, exhibit significant performance bottlenecks when applied to compressed images. 2) The principal factors influencing the robustness of CI SOD are rooted in the characteristics of compressed images and the limitations in saliency feature learning. Based on these observations, we propose a simple yet promising baseline framework that focuses on robust feature representation learning to achieve robust CNN-based CI SOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing markedly improved robustness across various levels of image degradation, while maintaining competitive accuracy on clean data. We hope that our benchmarking efforts, analytical insights, and proposed techniques will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the robustness of CNN-based SOD algorithms, inspiring future research in the community.
