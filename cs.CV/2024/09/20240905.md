- **Summary**: Training Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR) models using pixel-based regression losses can achieve high distortion metrics scores (e.g., PSNR and SSIM), but often results in blurry images due to insufficient recovery of high-frequency details. Conversely, using GAN or perceptual losses can produce sharp images with high perceptual metric scores (e.g., LPIPS), but may introduce artifacts and incorrect textures. Balancing these two types of losses can help achieve a trade-off between distortion and perception, but the challenge lies in tuning the loss function weights. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) into the training process of SISR models to balance perceptual quality and distortion. We conceptualize the relationship between loss weights and image quality assessment (IQA) metrics as black-box objective functions to be optimized within our Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization Super-Resolution (MOBOSR) framework. This approach automates the hyperparameter tuning process, reduces overall computational cost, and enables the use of numerous loss functions simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOBOSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both perceptual quality and distortion, significantly advancing the perception-distortion Pareto frontier. Our work points towards a new direction for future research on balancing perceptual quality and fidelity in nearly all image restoration tasks.

- **Summary**: We propose a Ground IoU (Gr-IoU) to address the data association problem in multi-object tracking. When tracking objects detected by a camera, it often occurs that the same object is assigned different IDs in consecutive frames, especially when objects are close to each other or overlapping. To address this issue, we introduce Gr-IoU, which takes into account the 3D structure of the scene. Gr-IoU transforms traditional bounding boxes from the image space to the ground plane using the vanishing point geometry. The IoU calculated with these transformed bounding boxes is more sensitive to the front-to-back relationships of objects, thereby improving data association accuracy and reducing ID switches. We evaluated our Gr-IoU method on the MOT17 and MOT20 datasets, which contain diverse tracking scenarios including crowded scenes and sequences with frequent occlusions. Experimental results demonstrated that Gr-IoU outperforms conventional real-time methods without appearance features.

- **Summary**: We study the problem of training an unbiased and accurate model given a dataset with multiple biases. This problem is challenging since the multiple biases cause multiple undesirable shortcuts during training, and even worse, mitigating one may exacerbate the other. We propose a novel training method to tackle this challenge. Our method first groups training data so that different groups induce different shortcuts, and then optimizes a linear combination of group-wise losses while adjusting their weights dynamically to alleviate conflicts between the groups in performance; this approach, rooted in the multi-objective optimization theory, encourages to achieve the minimax Pareto solution. We also present a new benchmark with multiple biases, dubbed MultiCelebA, for evaluating debiased training methods under realistic and challenging scenarios. Our method achieved the best on three datasets with multiple biases, and also showed superior performance on conventional single-bias datasets.

- **Summary**: Natural distribution shift causes a deterioration in the perception performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This comprehensive analysis for real-world traffic data addresses: 1) investigating the effect of natural distribution shift and weather augmentations on both detection quality and confidence estimation, 2) evaluating model performance for both classification and object localization, and 3) benchmarking two common uncertainty quantification methods - Ensembles and different variants of Monte-Carlo (MC) Dropout - under natural and close-to-natural distribution shift. For this purpose, a novel dataset has been curated from publicly available autonomous driving datasets. The in-distribution (ID) data is based on cutouts of a single object, for which both class and bounding box annotations are available. The six distribution-shift datasets cover adverse weather scenarios, simulated rain and fog, corner cases, and out-of-distribution data. A granular analysis of CNNs under distribution shift allows to quantize the impact of different types of shifts on both, task performance and confidence estimation: ConvNeXt-Tiny is more robust than EfficientNet-B0; heavy rain degrades classification stronger than localization, contrary to heavy fog; integrating MC-Dropout into selected layers only has the potential to enhance task performance and confidence estimation, whereby the identification of these layers depends on the type of distribution shift and the considered task.

- **Summary**: Object-Centric Learning (OCL) represents dense image or video pixels as sparse object features. Representative methods utilize discrete representation composed of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) template features to suppress pixel-level information redundancy and guide object-level feature aggregation. The most recent advancement, Grouped Discrete Representation (GDR), further decomposes these template features into attributes. However, its naive channel grouping as decomposition may erroneously group channels belonging to different attributes together and discretize them as sub-optimal template attributes, which losses information and harms expressivity. We propose Organized GDR (OGDR) to organize channels belonging to the same attributes together for correct decomposition from features into attributes. In unsupervised segmentation experiments, OGDR is fully superior to GDR in augmentating classical transformer-based OCL methods; it even improves state-of-the-art diffusion-based ones. Codebook PCA and representation similarity analyses show that compared with GDR, our OGDR eliminates redundancy and preserves information better for guiding object representation learning.
